# [Behn's Dotfiles] - Making my life easier...

These are my personal dotfiles, that I've built up over time through making repetitive tasks easier, and from other sources (Huge shoutout to [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)).

## Installation
**A fair warning...** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should probably fork this repo first, review the code within, and then remove/change anything you don't want/need - These work for me, but might not work out for you.

These files are managed by [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io) which allows me to easily manage and deploy my dotfiles across any machine I use - I'd recommend checking it out if you are using these dotfiles, or making your own.

## Contributing
I'll gladly accept PRs where they include something which may make my life easier - Feel free to contribute if you see anything missing that you feel could be useful!
